# Logging Allowlist - Files with known Log.* violations
#
# Purpose: Allow legacy code to exist while blocking NEW violations
# Strategy: Remove files from this list as they get refactored
#
# Format: One file path per line (relative to repo root)
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Blank lines are ignored
#
# Last updated: 2025-11-13
# Current progress: 37 logs refactored across 3 files (Phase 2b complete)
#
# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# ✅ REFACTORED FILES (Removed from allowlist):
# - modules/apps/VoiceOSCore/src/main/java/com/augmentalis/voiceoscore/scraping/VoiceCommandProcessor.kt (7 logs)
# - modules/apps/VoiceOSCore/src/main/java/com/augmentalis/voiceoscore/accessibility/recognition/VoiceRecognitionManager.kt (18 logs)
# - modules/apps/VoiceOSCore/src/main/java/com/augmentalis/voiceoscore/accessibility/extractors/UIScrapingEngine.kt (12 logs)

# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
# INFRASTRUCTURE FILES - Logging framework itself (PERMANENT)
# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# Logging framework - MUST use Log.* directly (wrapper implementation)

# LEGACY FILES - TODO: Refactor and remove from this list
# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# Large files - Phase 2c/2d (deferred - working code)

# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
# GOAL: Empty allowlist by Q1 2026
# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
#
# When refactoring a file:
# 1. Remove the file from this list
# 2. Commit the refactored file + updated allowlist together
# 3. Update "Last updated" date above
#
# To check remaining violations in a file:
#   grep -n "Log\.[diwev](" <file-path>
#
# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
# SpeechRecognition module - Library module that cannot import ConditionalLogger from VoiceOSCore
# Reason: Circular dependency - SpeechRecognition is included IN VoiceOSCore
# Resolution: Use standard Android Log.* is acceptable for library modules
# Added: 2025-11-21
# Files: All SpeechRecognition/*.kt files (library module exemption)
