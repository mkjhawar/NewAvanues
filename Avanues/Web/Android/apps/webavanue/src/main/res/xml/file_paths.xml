    SECURITY FIX: Restricted FileProvider paths (CWE-426)
    Previously had path="/" which exposed entire storage.
    Now restricted to app-specific directories only.
    -->

    <!-- Downloads directory - app-specific only -->
    <files-path name="downloads" path="downloads/" />

    <!-- Cache directory - app-specific only -->
    <cache-path name="cache" path="cache/" />

    <!-- External app files - restricted to Downloads subdirectory -->
    <external-files-path name="external_downloads" path="Download/" />

    <!-- REMOVED: Root path exposure vulnerabilities
    <external-path name="external" path="/" />
    <external-files-path name="external_files" path="/" />
    <external-cache-path name="external_cache" path="/" />
