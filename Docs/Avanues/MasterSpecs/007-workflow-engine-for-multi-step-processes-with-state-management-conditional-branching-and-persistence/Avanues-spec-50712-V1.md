## Executive Summary

Implement Workflow engine for multi-step processes with state management, conditional branching, and persistence

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
Users currently lack the functionality to workflow engine for multi-step processes with state management, conditional branching, and persistence.

**Pain Points:**
- Manual process is time-consuming
- Current workflow is inefficient
- User experience could be improved

**Desired State:**
Users can workflow engine for multi-step processes with state management, conditional branching, and persistence efficiently and intuitively through the application.
