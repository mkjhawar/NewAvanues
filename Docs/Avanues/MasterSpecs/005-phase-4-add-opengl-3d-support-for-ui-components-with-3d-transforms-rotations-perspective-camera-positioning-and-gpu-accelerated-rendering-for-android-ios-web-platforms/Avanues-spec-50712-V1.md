## Executive Summary

Implement Phase 4: Add OpenGL/3D support for UI components with 3D transforms, rotations, perspective, camera positioning, and GPU-accelerated rendering for Android/iOS/Web platforms

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
Users currently lack the functionality to phase 4: add opengl/3d support for ui components with 3d transforms, rotations, perspective, camera positioning, and gpu-accelerated rendering for android/ios/web platforms.

**Pain Points:**
- Manual process is time-consuming
- Current workflow is inefficient
- User experience could be improved

**Desired State:**
Users can phase 4: add opengl/3d support for ui components with 3d transforms, rotations, perspective, camera positioning, and gpu-accelerated rendering for android/ios/web platforms efficiently and intuitively through the application.
