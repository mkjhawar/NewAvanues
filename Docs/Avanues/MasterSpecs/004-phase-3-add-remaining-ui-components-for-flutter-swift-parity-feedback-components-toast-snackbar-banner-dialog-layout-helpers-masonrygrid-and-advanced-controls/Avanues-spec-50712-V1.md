## Executive Summary

Implement Phase 3: Add remaining UI components for Flutter/Swift parity - feedback components (Toast, Snackbar, Banner, Dialog), layout helpers (MasonryGrid), and advanced controls

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
Users currently lack the functionality to phase 3: add remaining ui components for flutter/swift parity - feedback components (toast, snackbar, banner, dialog), layout helpers (masonrygrid), and advanced controls.

**Pain Points:**
- Manual process is time-consuming
- Current workflow is inefficient
- User experience could be improved

**Desired State:**
Users can phase 3: add remaining ui components for flutter/swift parity - feedback components (toast, snackbar, banner, dialog), layout helpers (masonrygrid), and advanced controls efficiently and intuitively through the application.
