# 🚀 AI Command Quick Reference Card

## Workflow Commands
```
UD   = Update Documents
SCP  = Stage, Commit & Push (created files only)
SUF  = Stage, Update & Full workflow
```

## Review Patterns
```
COT  = Chain of Thought (linear reasoning)
ROT  = Reflection (evaluation)
TOT  = Train of Thought (explore alternatives)
CRT  = Combined Review (COT+ROT+TOT with options)
```

## Sequence Variations
```
CRT  = COT → ROT → TOT (standard)
TRC  = TOT → ROT → COT (explore first)
RCT  = ROT → COT → TOT (reflect first)
TCR  = TOT → COT → ROT (explore & validate)
RTC  = ROT → TOT → COT (reflect & explore)
CTR  = COT → TOT → ROT (chain & branch)
```

## Modifiers
```
-D   = Deep analysis
-S   = Shallow/quick
-F   = Fast (time-constrained)
-P   = Performance focus
-M   = Memory focus
-A   = Architecture focus
-O   = Options only
-R   = Recommendation only
-V   = Verbose
```

## Usage Examples
```
CRT      → Full analysis with options
CRT-P    → Performance-focused analysis
CRT-O    → Just show options
TRC      → Explore alternatives first
COT      → Step-by-step reasoning
```

## When to Use
- **Simple changes:** COT
- **Complex decisions:** CRT
- **Performance critical:** CRT-P
- **Architecture changes:** CRT (always)
- **Bug fixes:** COT
- **Refactoring:** TRC
