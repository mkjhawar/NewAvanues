## 🚫 FILES REQUIRING CONTENT EXTRACTION (SKIPPED - Agent 3 Handling)

These files contain BOTH general and VOS4-specific content and require content extraction by the specialized content extraction agent:

| Original Filename | General Target | VOS4 Target | Action |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|---------|
| MASTER-AI-INSTRUCTIONS.md | Guide-Master-AI-Instructions.md | Instructions-VOS4-Context-Master.md | Split by Agent 3 |
| MASTER-STANDARDS.md | Standards-Development-Core.md | Standards-VOS4-Architecture.md | Split by Agent 3 |
| SESSION-LEARNINGS.md | Reference-Common-Patterns-Learnings.md | Reference-VOS4-Session-Learnings.md | Split by Agent 3 |

## ✅ VERIFICATION RESULTS

### File Copy Verification

All 8 simple general files were successfully copied to the target directory with proper PascalCase-With-Hyphens naming:

1. ✅ Protocol-Precompaction.md
2. ✅ Protocol-Specialized-Agents.md
3. ✅ Protocol-Changelog-Management.md
4. ✅ Guide-Instruction-Reading-Sequence.md
5. ✅ Guide-Code-Index-System.md
6. ✅ Guide-Agent-Instructions-Maintenance.md
7. ✅ Reference-AI-Abbreviations-Quick.md
8. ✅ Reference-AI-Review-Patterns.md

### Naming Convention Compliance

All copied files follow the standardized naming convention:
- **Protocol-[Topic].md** for workflows and procedures
- **Guide-[Topic].md** for how-to documentation
- **Reference-[Topic].md** for quick reference cards

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (8/8 files)

### Original Files Preserved

All original files remain in their source locations (copy operation, not move):
- `/Volumes/M Drive/Coding/Warp/Agent-Instructions/` - Originals intact
- `/Volumes/M Drive/Coding/vos4/Agent-Instructions/` - Originals intact

**Archive Strategy:** Originals will be archived after 30-day verification period

## 🎯 ANALYSIS OF CATEGORIZATION REPORT CLAIMS

### "32 General Files" Breakdown

The categorization report claimed **32 general files (64%)** of 50 total unique files. Analysis shows:

1. **Simple general files:** 8 files ✅ (copied by this agent)
2. **General portions of split files:** 5 files → 10 outputs (Agent 3 handling)
3. **Additional general content:** Remainder to be extracted from other mixed files

**Note:** The "32 general files" includes both complete files AND general portions extracted from mixed-content files. This agent successfully handled all complete general files that didn't require content splitting.

## 📝 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Agent 3 Completion:** Wait for Agent 3 to complete content extraction of 5 mixed files
2. **Verification:** Review Agent 3's extracted general files for completeness
3. **Reference Updates:** Update references in CLAUDE.md and other files after all consolidation complete
4. **Archive Planning:** Plan 30-day verification period before archiving originals

### Future Consolidation Work

1. **VOS4-Specific Files:** Separate agent should handle VOS4-specific file consolidation
2. **Merge Verification:** Verify 8 already-merged files contain all original content
3. **Cross-Reference Check:** Automated script to verify all cross-references
4. **Testing:** Test with AI agents reading new structure
