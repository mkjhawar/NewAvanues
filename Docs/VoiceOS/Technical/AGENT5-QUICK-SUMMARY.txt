AGENT 5: LIFECYCLE TEST COMPLETER - QUICK SUMMARY
================================================================================

STATUS: ✅ READY TO RUN - ⚠️ BLOCKED BY BUILD

WORK COMPLETED:
✅ All 4 lifecycle tests analyzed
✅ All 4 lifecycle tests enabled (moved from java.disabled to java)
✅ Implementation classes verified (all exist)
✅ Test infrastructure verified (Phase 3 Agent 2)
✅ Status report created

TESTS ENABLED (51 total unit tests):
1. AsyncQueryManagerTest.kt         - 15 tests (async query caching)
2. AccessibilityNodeManagerSimpleTest.kt - 10 tests (node lifecycle)
3. AccessibilityNodeManagerTest.kt  - 11 tests (advanced nodes w/ Robolectric)
4. SafeNodeTraverserTest.kt         - 15 tests (tree traversal + cycle detection)

KEY FINDING:
✨ NO DATABASE MIGRATION NEEDED - all tests use mocking/test doubles
✨ Tests are pure lifecycle logic tests, not database tests

CURRENT BLOCKER:
⚠️  KSP build failures in CommandManager
⚠️  AAPT2 daemon errors
⚠️  Agent 1 responsible for fixing these

NEXT STEP:
⏳ Wait for Agent 1 to fix build system
⏳ Then run: ./gradlew :modules:apps:VoiceOSCore:testDebugUnitTest --tests "*.lifecycle.*"
⏳ Expected: 51/51 passing

ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 15 minutes after build fixed
