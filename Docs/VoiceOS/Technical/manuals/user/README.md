## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is exploration faster in the new version?

**Answer:** The December 2025 update includes major performance optimizations:

| Improvement | Technical Detail | User Impact |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Batch Database Operations** | Reduced from 315 DB ops → 2 ops per screen (157x reduction) | 27x faster element registration |
| **Click-Before-Register** | Elements clicked while fresh (not stale) | 95%+ elements now clickable (was 30-50%) |
| **Memory Optimization** | Fixed coroutine leaks in accessibility service | No crashes during long exploration sessions |

**Example:** A 63-element screen (like RealWear "My Controls") now takes 45ms to process instead of 1351ms.

**Bottom line:** You can explore entire apps in seconds instead of minutes, and VoiceOS captures nearly every element instead of missing half of them.
