## Component Overview

| Component | Role | Key Capability |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| **AVA AI Assistant** | Intelligence Layer | Understands what you mean, not just what you say |
| **VoiceOS Platform** | Control Layer | Executes actions on any application |
| **Avanues SDK** | Developer Tools | Build voice-first applications |
| **Avanues Cloud** | Optional Services | Sync, backup, enterprise management |

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

Imagine you're using a banking app and you say: **"Transfer $500 to Mom"**

Here's what happens in milliseconds:

1. **VoiceOS listens** and converts your voice to text (on your device)
2. **AVA understands** this is a money transfer, identifies "Mom" as a contact, recognizes "$500" as the amount
3. **VoiceOS scans** the banking app's screen, finds the transfer button, amount field, and contact picker
4. **AVA maps** your intent to the specific UI elements: "Transfer" button → amount field → contact selection
5. **VoiceOS executes** the actions: clicks Transfer, types 500, selects Mom from contacts
6. **AVA confirms**: "Transferring $500 to Mom. Should I proceed?"

**Total time: Under 2 seconds.**

This works for ANY app—even apps that have never been voice-enabled before.

### Why This Matters

| Scenario | Traditional Assistant | AVA |
|----------|----------------------|-----|
| "Click the blue button" | ❌ "I don't understand" | ✅ Finds and clicks blue button |
| "Go to settings" (with accent) | ❌ "Did you say 'go to sittings'?" | ✅ Understands intent, opens settings |
| "Send that to John" | ❌ "Send what to John?" | ✅ Knows "that" refers to current document |
| "Do what I did yesterday" | ❌ "I can't do that" | ✅ Recalls and repeats previous workflow |

## AVA's Core Capabilities

### 1. Contextual Understanding

AVA doesn't just hear words—it understands context:

**Screen Context**: AVA knows what app you're in, what's on screen, and what actions are possible.

```
User: "Send this"
AVA thinks: "User is in email app, draft is open, 'Send' button is visible"
AVA does: Clicks the Send button
```

**Conversation Context**: AVA remembers what you've discussed.

```
User: "Find Italian restaurants"
AVA: Shows list of Italian restaurants
User: "Call the second one"
AVA: Calls the second restaurant (remembers the list)
```

**Personal Context**: AVA learns your patterns.

```
User says "my usual" every morning
AVA learns: "my usual" = open email, check calendar, play news podcast
```

### 2. Intent Classification

AVA uses a fine-tuned BERT model (MobileBERT for speed, mALBERT for multilingual) to classify user intent:

**Supported Intent Categories**:

| Category | Example Commands | Actions |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Navigation** | "go back", "scroll down", "next page" | Screen navigation |
| **App Control** | "open Chrome", "close this app" | App launching/management |
| **UI Interaction** | "click Submit", "check the box" | Element interaction |
| **Text Input** | "type hello world", "delete that" | Text manipulation |
| **System** | "take screenshot", "turn on WiFi" | Device control |
| **Query** | "search for recipes", "what's the weather" | Information retrieval |
| **Media** | "play music", "pause video" | Media control |
| **Communication** | "call Mom", "send text to John" | Calls, messages |

### 3. Entity Extraction

AVA identifies and extracts key information from natural language:

| Entity Type | Example | Extracted Value |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| **App Name** | "open Instagram" | `instagram` |
| **Contact** | "call Mom" | Contact: Mom |
| **Amount** | "transfer $500" | `500 USD` |
| **URL** | "go to google.com" | `https://google.com` |
| **Date/Time** | "remind me tomorrow at 3" | `2026-01-17 15:00` |
| **Location** | "navigate to Central Park" | `Central Park, NYC` |

### 4. Disambiguation

When multiple elements match, AVA helps you choose:

```
User: "Click Submit"
Screen has: [Submit Order] [Submit Review] [Submit Feedback]

AVA: "I found 3 Submit buttons. Say 'one' for Submit Order,
      'two' for Submit Review, or 'three' for Submit Feedback."

User: "Two"
AVA: Clicks [Submit Review]
```

### 5. Learning & Adaptation

AVA learns from your usage:

**Command Learning**:
- Recognizes when you create custom workflows
- Suggests naming repeated action sequences
- Adapts synonym recognition to your vocabulary

**Voice Adaptation**:
- Improves recognition accuracy for your voice
- Learns your accent and speaking patterns
- Handles background noise patterns in your environment

**Preference Learning**:
- Remembers your preferred apps for actions
- Learns your typical workflows
- Adapts confirmation preferences (more/less verification)

## AVA's Language Models

### On-Device Models

| Model | Size | Languages | Speed | Use Case |
|-------|------|-----------|-------|----------|
| **MobileBERT** | 25 MB | English | <50ms | Fast intent classification |
| **mALBERT** | 41 MB | 52 languages | <80ms | Multilingual understanding |
| **Gemma 2B** | 1.5 GB | 10+ languages | 20-50 tok/s | Complex reasoning |

### Model Selection Logic

```
if (language == "en" && simple_command):
    use MobileBERT (fastest)
elif (language != "en"):
    use mALBERT (multilingual)
elif (complex_command || ambiguous):
    use Gemma 2B (smartest)
```

### Privacy Guarantee

**All AI processing happens on YOUR device.**

- Voice never sent to cloud servers
- No account required for core features
- Works completely offline
- Your data is YOUR data

**Field Work Example**:
```
Technician: "What's the oil capacity for a 2023 Caterpillar D6?"
AVA: "According to the Caterpillar D6 Service Manual, the engine oil
      capacity is 7.5 gallons (28.4 liters) with filter change.
      [Source: CAT-D6-Service-Manual.pdf, Page 234]"

Technician: "What oil weight?"
AVA: "The recommended oil is CAT DEO-ULS 10W-30 or 15W-40 depending
      on ambient temperature. For temperatures above 32°F, use 15W-40.
      [Source: CAT-D6-Service-Manual.pdf, Page 235]"
```

### 7. On-the-Fly Workflow Creation

AVA can learn and automate multi-step workflows from natural conversation:

**Workflow Learning Process**:
```
User: "Every morning I open email, check calendar, then open Slack"

AVA: "I noticed you do these 3 steps together often:
      1. Open Gmail
      2. Open Calendar
      3. Open Slack

      Would you like me to create a 'Morning Routine' workflow?"

User: "Yes"

AVA: "Done! Say 'morning routine' to run all three steps automatically."
```

**Advanced Multi-Step Workflows**:

| Workflow Type | Example | Complexity |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| **Sequential** | Open app → Navigate → Click button | Simple |
| **Conditional** | If (inbox > 10) then (open email) else (open calendar) | Medium |
| **Parallel** | Start timer AND play music AND dim lights | Medium |
| **Loop** | For each item in list: click → fill → submit | Complex |
| **Branching** | If order > $100: require approval, else: process | Complex |

### 8. AvaMagic - Voice-Driven App & UI Generation

**AvaMagic** is the generative component of Avanues Suite that creates custom interfaces, workflows, and mini-applications from voice commands.

**Core Capabilities**:

| Feature | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|

## Field Work Use Case: Wind Turbine Maintenance

**Scenario**: A field technician needs to perform a complex gearbox inspection 300 feet in the air, hands occupied with safety harness and tools.

### The Challenge

Traditional approach requires:
- Printed manual (can blow away, hard to read)
- Tablet with touch interface (difficult with gloves)
- Radio to supervisor for questions
- Paper checklist (gets dirty, lost)
- Camera for documentation (separate device)
- Separate reporting system

### The Avanues Suite Solution

**Step 1: Pre-Climb Preparation**

```
Technician: "AVA, I'm doing gearbox inspection on turbine 47.
             Load the maintenance workflow."

AVA: "Loading Gearbox Inspection Workflow for Turbine 47.
      I've found your uploaded Vestas V90 service manual.
      Pre-climb checklist has 8 items. Ready when you are."
```

**Step 2: AvaMagic-Generated Interface**

AVA automatically generates this voice-controlled inspection workflow:

# 6. VoiceOS Platform - The Control Layer

## What is VoiceOS?

**VoiceOS** is the execution platform that translates AVA's understanding into real actions on your device. While AVA is the brain, VoiceOS is the hands that interact with every application.

## How VoiceOS Works

### Universal Application Control

VoiceOS uses the operating system's accessibility APIs to interact with ANY application:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐     │
│  │  VoiceOS scans the current screen to identify:          │     │
│  │  • All interactive elements (buttons, fields, links)   │     │
│  │  • Element labels, descriptions, and types             │     │
│  │  • Element locations and relationships                  │     │
│  │  • App framework (native, web, Flutter, React Native)  │     │
│  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘     │
│                         │                                        │
│                         ▼                                        │
│  2. ELEMENT MATCHING                                             │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐     │
│  │  When you say "click Submit", VoiceOS:                  │     │
│  │  • Searches for elements containing "Submit"           │     │
│  │  • Ranks by relevance (exact match > partial > similar)│     │
│  │  • Considers context (visible, enabled, clickable)     │     │
│  │  • Uses AVID fingerprints for precise identification   │     │
│  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘     │
│                         │                                        │
│                         ▼                                        │
│  3. ACTION EXECUTION                                             │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐     │
│  │  VoiceOS performs the action via accessibility APIs:    │     │
│  │  • Click, tap, long-press, double-tap                  │     │
│  │  • Scroll, swipe, drag                                  │     │
│  │  • Type text, select, copy, paste                       │     │
│  │  • Navigate, switch apps, go back                       │     │
│  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘     │
│                                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

4. Learns your preferred terminology

**Example**:
```
You open a new banking app for the first time.
VoiceOS automatically learns:
- "Check balance" → taps Balance button
- "Transfer money" → taps Transfer button
- "Pay bills" → taps Pay Bills button
- "View transactions" → taps History button

For existing applications, VoiceOS provides automatic voice control with no code changes:

```
User installs VoiceOS
          ↓
User opens your app
          ↓
VoiceOS automatically scans UI elements
          ↓
Voice commands work immediately

No SDK integration required.
```

### Option 2: Enhanced Integration (Minimal Code)

Add accessibility labels to improve voice command quality:

```kotlin
// Android (Jetpack Compose)
Button(
    onClick = { /* action */ },
    modifier = Modifier.semantics {
        contentDescription = "Submit Order"  // VoiceOS uses this
        // User can now say "click Submit Order"
    }
) {
    Text("Submit")
}
```

```swift
// iOS (SwiftUI)
Button("Submit") {
    // action
}
.accessibilityLabel("Submit Order")  // VoiceOS uses this
```

### Option 3: Full SDK Integration (Custom Commands)

For complete control, integrate the Avanues SDK:

```kotlin
// Initialize Avanues SDK
val avanues = AvanuesSDK.builder()
    .setApplication(application)
    .setLanguage("en-US")
    .enableCustomCommands(true)
    .build()

// Register custom voice commands
avanues.registerCommand(
    phrase = "checkout",
    variations = listOf("complete purchase", "buy now", "finish order"),
    action = { processCheckout() }
)

// Register multi-step workflow
avanues.registerWorkflow(
    name = "quick reorder",
    steps = listOf(
        "Open order history",
        "Select last order",
        "Click reorder",
        "Confirm purchase"
    ),
    action = { quickReorder() }
)

// Listen for voice events
avanues.onVoiceCommand { command ->
    analytics.log("Voice command: ${command.phrase}")
}
```
