# Phase 2: Production Implementation (2-4 hours) - Implementation Instructions

## Overview
This phase implements the core functionality for the  feature.

## Profile: android-app

## Architecture Components


## Integration Points


## Key Tasks


## Implementation Guidelines

### Core Logic Implementation
1. Implement business logic layer (services/repositories)
2. Add proper error handling and logging
3. Use consistent naming conventions
4. Follow SOLID principles
5. Implement proper state management

### UI/Component Implementation
1. Create components following architecture pattern
2. Implement user interactions and event handlers
3. Connect to business logic layer
4. Add loading states and error messages
5. Ensure accessibility compliance

### Integration
1. Connect new components to existing systems
2. Use dependency injection patterns
3. Follow existing code conventions
4. Maintain backward compatibility
5. Handle edge cases and errors gracefully

## Code Standards
- Follow project coding standards and style guides
- Use proper TypeScript/Kotlin/Java typing
- Add JSDoc/KDoc comments for public APIs
- Write readable, maintainable code
- Refactor as needed to improve clarity

## Validation Checklist


## Testing Strategy
- Write tests alongside implementation
- Aim for high code coverage
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Verify integration with existing systems

## Time Estimate
 (estimated)

## Risks and Mitigations
- No major risks identified for this phase

```

### File Templates

No specific templates for this phase. Follow existing project patterns.

### Testing Guidance

- Write unit tests for business logic
- Write integration tests for components
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Verify async operations complete correctly

### Quality Gates



### Key Considerations

- Follow established code patterns and conventions
- Write code that is testable and maintainable
- Handle errors gracefully with proper messages
- Optimize performance early
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- Use feature flags for large changes
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Copy-paste code instead of proper abstraction**
- **Not handling errors appropriately**
- **Ignoring performance implications**
- **Inconsistent naming and style**
- **Over-engineering simple solutions**
- **Forgetting to handle edge cases**
- **Writing code that is hard to test**
