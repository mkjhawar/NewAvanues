# Baseline Results

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Mode**: YOLO (skipped baseline test runs)

## Test Baselines (Expected)

**VOS4**: 8 encryption tests (from Phase 1-3 implementation)
**MagicCode**: 282 tests (per documentation)

## Diff Results (T007-T009)

Skipped in YOLO mode - proceeding directly to file synchronization.

**Assumption**: VOS4 and MagicCode have minimal differences (cosmetic only) based on divergence analysis.

## Notes

YOLO mode means we trust the previous analysis and proceed with synchronization.
Tests will be run after Phase 3 (US1) completion to verify 290 total tests pass.
